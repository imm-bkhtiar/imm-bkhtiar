**`[Web Developer/Deesigner/Video Editor]`**

I'm a fresh graduate who used to be uninterested in the world of technology. My journey to this field began in an unexpected way. I started looking for ways to fill up time and discover new interests. That's where I discovered the amazing world of technology. From the beginning I doubted, now I felt drowned in the ignorance of learning new things in this field.

Technology has become my ambition, and I am determined to pursue a career in this field with enthusiasm. This journey not only changed my view of technology but also opened up opportunities and potential that I had never imagined before. I'm ready to face the challenge and keep learning so that I can make a meaningful contribution to the world of technology.
